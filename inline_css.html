    <h2><p style="color:blueviolet"><i>Font Families</i></h2>
    <body>
        <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size:20px;">In the microsoft family applications, there are different tools and procedures that each of the branches holds. 
        One of the biggest tools in the microsoft branches is called "Font Family," this tool in particular is used to choose the different appearances of the characters.
        The font size is the first, this allows you to create the size of the characters making them bigger or smaller, it is mostly measured in with the x-display (ex. 16x, 54x).
        The next one its the font-weight, this basically, allows you to make changes in the characters appearance, making them thick or thin.
        Now comes the font-style property, each of the characters can be adjusted by a different appearance such as italic (the slanted version) of another example is Times New Roman, which happens to be my favorite.
        Lastly, the final platform to look at is the font-property, as said before, you are allowed to adjust and make changes to specific titles, sentences and others characters, so that all of them do not look the same. 
        This is usually how people work on the projects or work assignments and using these tools is a fantastic help in creativity, every piece of work you put into a written document 
        or a powerpoint for example, it shows that you are expressing your determination and all of your hard work.</p> 
    
        
    <h3><p style="color:green">Color of Expression</p></h3>    
    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-size:22px;">There is one of the biggest thing that almost everything including objects have, color, I will admit though, the only thing I can think of that does not have color is water.
    Color is a very huge aspect in the world, however, you can not always tell what a color is just by looking at it or guessing. If you were looking at a random web page and you saw an image of art that you believe was astounding, but you could not tell what colors were used,
    by going to the Rio Salado Color Tool, this data base can identify the different color increments. Even if it was a text, this website or tool will allow to use text and images to identify the specific colors used. 
    I personally think this has got to be one of the most interesting ideal aspects I have ever seen, and possibly going to use this tool in the future as well. The three ways tat you can usually indicate color on a web page or text is through RGB color, hexadecimal color, and color names.
    Red, green, and blue are actually the most modest colors in practically anything, not even I knew that. Even writing an everyday paper can always be made into something new, or heck, even be presented as art.</p>
